#note outliers in the plots vs HP, are these the same pokemon with special stats.
#can we use a cluster algorithm for this e.g. k-means?
#general clusters form for most stats, what happens if we segregate into types?
#would be good to have evolution stage as a variable
#what level are these pokemon?
